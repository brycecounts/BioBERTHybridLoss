Biomedical event classification is a difficult challenge due to class imbalance and semantic overlap between event types. This project introduces a hybrid loss function that combines focal loss with Sinkhorn divergence to fine-tune a BioBERT-based  classification of biomedical events. In particular, we focus specifically on three biological processes: phosphorylation, inhibition and activation. We demonstrate the usefulness of this method using the BioNLP GENIA dataset.
